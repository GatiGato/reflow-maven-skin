Reflow skin builds on [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap] and supports predefined and custom
Bootstrap themes. They are set using the `<theme>` element in the customization:

[bootstrap]: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

```xml
<custom>
  <reflowSkin>
    ...
    <theme>default|site|bootswatch-*</theme>
    ...
  </reflowSkin>
</custom>
```

There are several options for the `<theme>` value:

-   **`default`**
    
    (**Default**: will be used if `<theme>` is not set).
    
    Default Bootstrap theme (version ${bootstrapVersion}). The default theme (with minor customizations)
    is used for this website.
    
    The default Bootstrap theme is loaded from the
    [BootstrapCDN Content Delivery Network][bootstrapcdn], which improves website loading
    by hosting the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files.

-   **`site`**
    
    A customized (local) Bootstrap theme. This option should be used when a custom Bootstrap
    theme is developed and included with the Maven site. The theme expects the following
    Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files to be available in `src/site/resources`:
    
    -   `css/bootstrap.min.css`
    -   `css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css`
    -   `js/bootstrap.min.js`
    
    The files can be customized and generated at [Bootstrap's Customize page][bootstrap-custom].

-   **`bootswatch-*`**<span id="theme-bootswatch"></span>
    
    One of free Bootstrap themes from [Bootswatch][bootswatch]. Append the lowercase theme name
    in the [Bootswatch gallery][bootswatch-gallery], e.g. `bootswatch-readable`.
    
    Bootswatch themes (default version ${bootstrapVersion}) are loaded from the
    [BootstrapCDN Content Delivery Network][bootstrapcdn].
    
    Preview full themes at the [Bootswatch gallery][bootswatch-gallery],
    or check out several examples of Reflow skin using Bootswatch themes below.
